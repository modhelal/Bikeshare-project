Bikeshare Project
In this project we explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City and Chicago, we use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider, to uncover bike share usage patterns.
It is a two phase project, the First about filtering and loading the specified data, and the Second about analyzing data considering four main categories:
* Popular times of travel
* Popular stations and trip
* Trip duration
* User information           

During working on the project, there was some points I've searched and found 
different methods to deal with them and I have applied them in different parts of script, there are some points treated with different methods for the same result like in get_filter function and in duration_trip function.

The main tools used during working:
Python version 3.1.0
Anaconda version 4.10.3
Git Bash
